@cindex random numbers
@cindex quasi-random numbers
@cindex distribution functions


Nearly all interface calls from the following areas are mapped:

@itemize
@item Random numbers
@item Quasi-random numbers
@item Random distributions
@end itemize
@noindent
In particular, all random number generators are available. The
following routines are not available:
@example
  gsl_rng_state
  gsl_rng_size
  gsl_rng_types_setup
  gsl_qrng_size
  gsl_qrng_state
@end example
@noindent Before use of the I/O routines it is necessary to properly
initialize a stream I/O object as described in  @sc{Using the interface}, 
(@pxref{I/O routines})
