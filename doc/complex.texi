@cindex complex numbers

Since the Fortran standard provides extensive support for complex
numbers, ony those routines for which no Fortran intrinsic is
available are mapped in FGSL. Instead of an argument
of type @code{gsl_complex}, a standard Fortran
@code{complex(fgsl_double}) is used for all mapped functions.
Here's the list of mapped functions:
@itemize
@item @code{fgsl_complex_arg, fgsl_complex_logabs, fgsl_complex_log10}
@item @code{fgsl_complex_log_b, fgsl_complex_arcsin, fgsl_complex_arcsin_real}
@item @code{fgsl_complex_arccos, fgsl_complex_arccos_real, fgsl_complex_arctan}
@item @code{fgsl_complex_arcsec, gsl_complex_arcsec_real, fgsl_complex_arccsc}
@item @code{fgsl_complex_arccot, fgsl_complex_arcsinh, fgsl_complex_arccosh}
@item @code{fgsl_complex_arccosh_real, fgsl_complex_arctanh}
@item @code{fgsl_complex_arctanh_real, fgsl_complex_arccsch, fgsl_complex_arccoth}
@end itemize
