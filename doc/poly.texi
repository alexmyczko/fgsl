The GSL API is completely mapped. Again, complex arguments use the 
standard Fortran @code{complex(fgsl_double)} type instead of
@code{gsl_complex}. In particular, the routine
@code{fgsl_poly_complex_solve} uses a @code{complex(fgsl_double)} array; however
additional working space of @code{n fgsl_double} words is needed
internally. In the present FGSL release, no reliance is put upon the 
identical memory layout for Fortran complex numbers and GSL compressed
complex pointer storage. This may change in future releases.
