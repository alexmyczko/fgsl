Since the Fortran standard provides extensive support for complex numbers, ony those routines for which no Fortran intrinsic is available are mapped in F\+G\+S\+L. Instead of an argument of type {\ttfamily gsl\+\_\+complex}, a standard Fortran {\ttfamily complex(fgsl\+\_\+double)} is used for all mapped functions.
