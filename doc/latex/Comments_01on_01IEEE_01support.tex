Please go to \hyperlink{ieee_8finc}{api/ieee.\-finc} for the A\-P\-I documentation. interaction between the Fortran run time settings and C may lead to unreliable behaviour; for example, setting of I\-E\-E\-E rounding apparently does not always work correctly. Within Fortran, usage of the facilities defined in the intrinsic I\-E\-E\-E modules is the reliable and therefore appropriate method.
