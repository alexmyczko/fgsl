Please go to \hyperlink{montecarlo_8finc}{api/montecarlo.\+finc} for the A\+P\+I documentation. Note\+: in G\+S\+L 1.\+13, accessors were also added to G\+S\+L. They\textquotesingle{}re slightly different named and have a differing interface from fgsl\+\_\+monte\+\_\+$\ast$\+\_\+?etparams routines already existing in F\+G\+S\+L. To preserve backward compatibility, the F\+G\+S\+L accessors are retained.
