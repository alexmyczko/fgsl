Please go to \hyperlink{array_8finc}{api/array.\-finc} for the A\-P\-I documentation. Since array processing is one of the strengths of Fortran, F\-G\-S\-L focuses on leveraging Fortran-\/style array processing for those G\-S\-L routines which require arguments of type {\ttfamily fgsl\-\_\-vector$\ast$} or {\ttfamily fgsl\-\_\-matrix$\ast$}.
